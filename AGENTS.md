# Project Agent Notes

- Keep this repo generic and anonymous: do not reference any private app name, brand, domains, or internal infrastructure in docs/comments/examples/commit messages.
- Never paste secrets (API keys, access tokens, private URLs) into the repo or commit messages.
- This repo is intended to be copied to GPU VMs for building and running a Docker image; only copy what is needed for the worker.
